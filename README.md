# Robot_Navigation
Final project for my Advanced-Microprocessor Based System Design class
Created and implemented in Code Composer Studio, this code utilizes C to program a MSP432 board from Texas Instruments
that is attached to a TI-RSLK MAX kit that includes wheels, board, and bumpers. Along with that,
the QTRK line sensor is used to allow the robot to read the track that is "drawn" with black tape.
